# Swiero project (Wiiero Reboot)
Reboot of my 10-Year-Olds Wiiero project (liero clone for console).

Swiero/Wiiero are clones of Liero specially developped for Wii.
Liero is a fight game between two worms armed with heavy weapons of all kinds battling in underground caves.
It was created by the Finnish programmer Joosa Riekkinen in 1998.
The game is often described as a real-time version of Worms, or a 2D version of Quake III.
Its last release was version 1.33, released in 1999.
