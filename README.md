# Swiero project (Wiiero Reboot)
Reboot of my 10-Year-Olds [Wiiero](http://wiiero.free.fr/) project (liero clone for console).

Swiero/Wiiero are clones of Liero specially developped for Wii.
Liero is a fight game between two worms armed with heavy weapons of all kinds battling in underground caves.
It was created by the Finnish programmer Joosa Riekkinen in 1998.
The game is often described as a real-time version of Worms, or a 2D version of Quake III.
Its last release was version 1.33, released in 1999.

## Swiero / Wiiero

You play Swiero/Wiiero exctly the same way as you played Liero: same game modes, same original weapons, coming with new ones like vermifuge, holy grenade, or even plasma canon! 

Wiiero is a two player game, using the wiimote alone or both wiimote and nunchuk on the Wii and keyboard on PC.

In wiiero game you can fight your opponent in 3 different game modes:

* __Deathmatch:__ The goal of the "deathmatch" mode is simply killing the enemy by hurting him the most possible. Lives are mimited and the player with no more lives will be the loser. You can define the number of lives for both players in the "option" menu.

* __Capture the flag:__ The goal of the "game of tag" is to kill the enemy for him to become the "tag". When a player is the "tag", his time counter decreases. When your counter reaches 0, the game is over and you lost. However, you can kill your enemy before that time and he becomes the "tag", his counter will therefor begin decreasing. The time limit can be modified in the "option" menu.

* __Game of tag:__ Finaly, in the "capture the flag" mode, you will need to get your opponents flag somewhere on the map and take it back to your home, giving you 1 point. However, to pick up your opponents flag, he must not be in possession of your own flag. Otherwise you will need to kill him! The first player accumulating the defined number of flags wins.  You can modify the limit of flags in the "option" menu.
